A small library to get data from a compellent, including a Nagios check.

The nagios check will check the replication status and provide a
warning if the estimated time to finish the replication is above the
given threshold.  For an example of how to use the nagios check,
see the templates-compellent.cfg file.

The nagios check will also optionally create a log file that can be
used to graph the performance of the replication.  This file is a
space-separated format with the following columns

    current_time
    blocksremaining
    current_rate
    average_rate
    remaining_time
    accumulate_time_in_CRIT



Example of using the test tool to download data from a table:

Q: What is the current PITC for each volume?

A:
./clitest --no-check-certificate --username=Admin \
    --host=$HOSTNAME --password=$PASSWORD \
    table TYPE_VOLUME OperStatus 1 Index Name ActivePitcIndex

Index,Name,ActivePitcIndex
115,vol9,15000
126,vol10,50484
130,vol11,43922
132,vol12,33440
146,vol13,15274
153,vol14,5
155,vol15,15025
157,vol16,8998
161,vol17,4784
163,vol18,4174
164,vol19,4173


clitest has the following sub-commands:

table $tablename [$column $matchto [$row ...]]
    Do a generic table download (See the tables.seen.txt file for possible
    table names)

repl_blocksremaining
    output the total of the table TYPE_CMS BlocksRemaining column

repl_stateok
    ** This report does not provide completely known data **
    want a report that says that replication is not paused, is
    not missing and a couple of other things

repl_missing
    give a report on which volumes do not have replication setup

    "replication setup" is defined as showing up as either the source
    or dest volume in the copy/mirror/swap table

repl_pitc
    give a report on the date of the most recent PITC for each volume

If none of the above sub-commands are given, then the commandline is
interpreted as a raw query type and table name. (useful mostly for
debugging)
